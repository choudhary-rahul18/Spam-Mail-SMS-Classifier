# Spam Mail & SMS Classifier
A machine-learning project that builds and deploys two separate spam detection systems:
SMS Spam Classifier
Email Spam Classifier
Both classifiers are trained using TF-IDF Vectorization and multiple ML models. The final deployed models are:
* Logistic Regression
* Multinomial Naive Bayes
* Random Forest Classifier
  
A Streamlit app (app.py) loads the saved vectorizers + trained models to provide real-time predictions.
